Description of files used and generated alongside maps.

== Compiled files

[[mapname.bsp]]
link:#mapname.bsp[_mapname_.bsp]::
*Binary Space Partition*. The compiled and playable map file.

[[mapname.ext]]
link:#mapname.ext[_mapname_.ext]::
*Extent File*. A file containing calculated face extents of the BSP. Used by RAD/LIGHT compiler to perform calculations.
+
Not needed in distrobutions.

[[mapname.log]]
link:#mapname.log[_mapname_.log]::
*Log File*. Generated compile log file from the compiler processes.
+
Not needed in distrobutions.

[[mapname.map]]
link:#mapname.map[_mapname_.map]::
*Map File*. Generated map file from the original Hammer or J.A.C.K. source file (.vmf, .jmf, .rmf). This map file is used by the CSG compiler.
+
Not needed in distributions.

[[mapname.prt]]
link:#mapname.prt[_mapname_.prt]::
*Portal File*. Generated by the BSP compiler and contains a list of portals in BSP file and used by VIS compiler to perform visibility calculations.
+
Not needed in distrobutions.

[[mapname.pts]]
link:#mapname.pts[_mapname_.pts]::
*Points File*. Generated by the compiler tools and contains data about leaks in the map. Only generated if leaks were found during compilation.
+
Not needed in distributions.

[[mapname.lin]]
link:#mapname.lin[_mapname_.lin]::
*Linear Points File*. Generated by the compiler tools and contains data about leaks in the map in a more linear fashion. Only generated if leaks were found during compilation.
+
This is usually favoured over the points file as it provides more linear lines, which makes them easier to track down.
+
Not needed in distributions.

[[mapname.wa_]]
link:#mapname.wa_[_mapname_.wa_]::
*WAD File*. A wad file containing included wad files (`-wadinclude`) within the compiled map. Used by RAD/LIGHT compiler to perform calculations.
+
Not needed in distributions.

== Text Files

[[mapname.txt]]
link:#mapname.txt[_mapname_.txt]::
*Map Description Text* File. A file containing information about the map. This is no longer used, use <<mapname_motd.txt,`mapname_motd.txt`>> instead.

[[mapname_motd.txt]]
link:#mapname_motd.txt[_mapname_motd_.txt]::
*Message of the* Day Text File. A file containing information about the map. This content is shown at map start.

[[mapname_models.txt]]
link:#mapname_models.txt[_mapname_models_.txt]::
*Models Text File*. A file containing a list of model paths and their replacement model paths.

[[mapname_detail.txt]]
link:#mapname_detail.txt[_mapname_detail_.txt]::
*Detail Text File*. A file containing a list of detail textures mapping. Used for overlaying detail images on existing textures within the map.

[[mapname_readme.txt]]
link:#mapname_readme.txt[_mapname_readme_.txt]::
*Readme Text File*. A file describing the map. Not used by Sven Co-Op.

[[mapname_credits.txt]]
link:#mapname_credits.txt[_mapname_credits_.txt]::
*Credits Text File*. A file describing credits for the map. Not used by Sven Co-Op.

[[mapname_materials.txt]]
link:#mapname_materials.txt[_mapname_materials_.txt]::
*Materials Text File*. A file containing a list of textures and their coresponding sound.

[[mapname_sentences.txt]]
link:#mapname_sentences.txt[_mapname_sentences_.txt]::
*Sentences Text File*. A file containg a list of VOX sounds.

[[mapname.cfg]]
link:#mapname.cfg[_mapname_.cfg]::
*Map Settings Configuration*. A file for configuring map settings for the specific map. Overwrites settings in `default_map_settings.cfg`.

[[mapname_skl.cfg]]
link:#mapname_skl.cfg[_mapname_skl_.cfg]::
*Skill Configuration*. A file describing skills for NPCs and monsters within the map.

[[mapname.res]]
link:#mapname.res[_mapname_.res]::
*Resource File*. A file containing a list of resources to be pre-loaded map load for client.

[[mapname.gmr]]
link:#mapname.gmr[_mapname_.gmr]::
*Global Model Replacement*. A file containing a list of model paths and their replacement model paths.

[[mapname.gsr]]
link:#mapname.gsr[_mapname_.gsr]::
*Global Sound Replacement*. A file containing a list of sound paths and their replacement sound paths.
